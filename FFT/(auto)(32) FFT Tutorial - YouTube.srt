1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,399
here we are again everybody is Tony and

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,259
Ian from Tektronix nice to see you guys

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,680
are back we're going to do a video on

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,330
FFT that's right the fast Fourier

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,040
transform okay

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
so just what is it the ends just a

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,519
different way of looking at your signal

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,139
on oscilloscopes we're used to looking

9
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,210
at voltage changing over time

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,990
FFT just shows you instead what voltages

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,689
are present at each frequency I get that

12
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,390
that's a good okay

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,070
so this is the kind of a clear way of

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,929
looking at this right if you can imagine

15
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,820
your signal as a bunch of wire tangled

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,790
together the FFT just helps you untangle

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,950
it and see what it's made up see what

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,110
components are lurking in that signal my

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,390
tangled hair exactly hey what are you

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:42,750
saying

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,510
yeah no you're okay okay I used

22
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,300
conditioner this morning come on so

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,410
let's say you're designing a circuit

24
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,329
you're going to send some RF energy out

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,180
an antenna so you're going to pull out

26
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,920
that into in a plug in a BNC cable

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,500
connect it to your scope now because

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,390
you're generating a sine wave you expect

29
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,180
to see the voltage changing sinusoidal e

30
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,280
over time and that would be represented

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,310
in the FFT by one spike because there's

32
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,680
one frequency exactly you got it already

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,900
happen excellent but imagine that you

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,670
plug this into what you actually see is

35
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,280
a second spike right here that is

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,990
excellent and you wouldn't see that

37
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,490
right there the sine wave because it's

38
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,009
so low level it's such a miniscule

39
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,720
second signal that you have to have

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,189
something like the FFT to bring it out

41
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,600
there's no way I could have seen that

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,630
and on a real scope you'd look and you'd

43
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,759
find out well if I'm expecting 900

44
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,820
megahertz and I got 1800 megahertz

45
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,740
that's a harmonic I probably have some

46
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,960
harmonic distortion there are other

47
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,030
causes and this isn't just Photoshop

48
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,189
this is this is this is real right there

49
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:44,579
either

50
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,560
arrows photoshopped I can't believe that

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,570
it's so good so there are some other

52
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,430
common causes of interference we're just

53
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,409
going to kind of let those sit on the

54
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,210
slide for a second so that after the end

55
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,860
of the video you can jump back here and

56
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,659
you thought it was harmonic because

57
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,399
where it was at exactly the frequent if

58
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,570
it were somewhere else maybe would have

59
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,100
been crosstalk from a clock signal

60
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,909
that's really handy so let's talk about

61
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,009
how it actually works there's this

62
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,000
beautiful property of mathematic

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,550
where every signal can be thought of as

64
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,220
the sum of a bunch of sine waves did you

65
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,960
hear him he said every sec any signal

66
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,640
you want any shape name is shave let's

67
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,140
do the square wave square wave by

68
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,640
coincidence that's what's on this next

69
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,090
card yes even yes Tony even a square

70
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,700
wave is the sum of a bunch of sideways

71
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,950
let's see how that works if we wanted to

72
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,200
make a square wave by adding together a

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,540
bunch of sine waves we'd start with a

74
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,600
single sine wave how smooth yeah very

75
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,250
smooth it's almost like we've done a

76
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,680
bunch of failed take to this video no

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,020
way so if we add a sine wave to nothing

78
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,550
we get a sine wave okay 1 2 1

79
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,470
I got it in it right and that would

80
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,620
cause a single spike to appear in the

81
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,020
frequency domain now we're going to add

82
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,200
a second sine wave that's 1/3 as tall

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,380
and it's been scaled in by 1/3 and this

84
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,420
is the mathematical part this is like

85
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,310
there's two humps within this big one

86
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,290
yes exactly when we add those two

87
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,980
together that's going to add a little

88
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,390
yeah as you say that's going to add a

89
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,830
little hump at the top and bottom of

90
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,269
each of these and in the frequency

91
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,450
domain here because it's two sine waves

92
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,220
that's two peaks so let's add a third

93
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,580
one instead of this one being scaled by

94
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,290
a third it's scaled by a fifth I see and

95
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,610
when we add that it's going to add even

96
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,820
more wiggles it's going to make the size

97
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,880
steeper it's going to make the tops and

98
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,130
bottoms flatter and you notice we're

99
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,190
kind of closing in on a square wave here

100
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,049
so then we go to a cell get squared up

101
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,540
here Oh terrible okay we're going to a

102
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,700
seventh and one night to 111th and so on

103
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,140
and so we keep adding Peaks until it

104
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,549
kind of vanishes down into the noise

105
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,640
floor oh yeah and we recognize that that

106
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,890
goes down like that

107
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,150
now let's hang on to this guard we'll

108
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,530
compare it with the real scope in a

109
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,870
minute okay so real world signals have

110
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,760
the same property they might look like a

111
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,579
tingle in the time domain and then a

112
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,500
nice neat shape well it's just probably

113
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,549
something here from

114
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,650
with lots of tangled signals yes how to

115
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,199
break them down so let's see this on our

116
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,229
real scope yeah let's take that away so

117
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,370
we're gonna see what this looks like on

118
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,370
a traditional oscilloscope first most

119
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,740
modern oscilloscopes have an FFT feature

120
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,770
they're usually the math system so we're

121
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,479
going to press math FFT and right away

122
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,000
you can see that signal tapering way off

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,530
down in the noise floor but let's zoom

124
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,150
in on that a little bit it's like in our

125
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:55,220
drawing right tapers off yes so you can

126
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,139
see that tapering off there in fact I'll

127
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,919
move it down a little bit sure you know

128
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,300
your way around this house cope don't

129
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,240
you this one feature I do so can we get

130
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,180
the card that we haven't you earlier

131
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,430
there you go you see that looks pretty

132
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,639
much like the FFT there I see that angle

133
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,800
and I see the angle all right genius

134
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,719
there's another class of instruments

135
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,360
that also do a lot of FFTs and that's

136
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,659
spectrum analyzers and this is so scope

137
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,009
the mixed domain oscilloscope has a

138
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,180
little bit of spectrum analyzer

139
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,969
personality built-in and it can do a

140
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:31,460
fifties as well mixed domain mix so many

141
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,500
things going together so we've got Italy

142
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,409
handy sorry okay we hope it is so we've

143
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,880
got one signal going to both the

144
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,259
traditional scope channel and this

145
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,719
dedicated spectrum analyzer channel I'm

146
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:44,300
going to turn that on oh and right away

147
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,130
you see a difference I do yeah

148
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,469
both types of views are right there

149
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:49,729
exactly we've got the frequency domain

150
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,949
view in a separate view and you can see

151
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,919
that second peak stands right out and

152
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,050
we've even marked it and identified that

153
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,240
it's spaced from the original 900

154
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,069
megahertz by 900 megahertz and it's down

155
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,069
about 25 dB so you put the marker in

156
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:05,449
here or did it mark it for you it marked

157
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,789
it for us so that tells us it's probably

158
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,710
harmonic distortion so this concludes

159
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,289
our video on FFT yes there's more right

160
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,219
there's more if you want to learn more

161
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,469
about FFTs you can go to Tektronix comm

162
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:18,979
slash FFT - basics and there's a lot of

163
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,440
stuff there yes and also stay tuned for

164
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,180
the next video of this series where we

165
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,689
do

166
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:26,029
FFT of a musical signal in front of a

167
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:28,459
live audience that sounds great see you

168
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:31,330
around okay thanks
