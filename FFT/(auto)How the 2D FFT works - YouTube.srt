1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,340
in this video I'm going to explain the

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,910
2d Fourier transform in some sense the

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,760
2d Fourier transform is just a simple

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,429
and straightforward extension of the 1d

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,320
Fourier transform that you've been

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,170
learning about so far

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,820
unfortunately however it's not all that

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,710
simple

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,170
well implementing the 2d F of T really

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,350
is simple the problem is interpreting

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,810
the results of a 2d Fourier transform

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,140
and even more complicated is trying to

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,669
predict what an image might look like

14
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,200
based on its 2d FFT power spectrum first

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,000
let me explain how pictures are

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,030
represented on computers when you have a

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,219
picture like this your computer

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,760
represents this as a matrix and the

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,039
color in each little matrix element

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,100
corresponds to a number so in fact the

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,590
matrix looks like this and you can see

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,899
that larger numbers have darker colors

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,170
now when you have data organized in a

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,129
matrix like this the 2d FFT works by

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,490
first taking a one-dimensional FFT along

26
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,340
the columns of this matrix and this

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,310
produces a matrix of one dimensional

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,890
Fourier coefficients and that you can

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,430
see in this image frequency is on the y

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,619
axis the top row is the DC component and

31
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,270
all of these values are Fourier

32
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,060
coefficients for the Fourier transform

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,360
from each column the next step is to

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,930
perform a 1d FFT on the rows of this

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,869
matrix the result of this step is a two

36
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,090
dimensional matrix of Fourier

37
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,850
coefficients in this matrix the

38
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,220
low-frequency coefficients are around

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,710
the edges and the corners while the

40
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,700
Nyquist is at the center of the matrix

41
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,500
you'll recall that in a previous video I

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,930
showed that in some disciplines people

43
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,990
show the 1d power spectrum with DC in

44
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,060
the middle negative frequencies on the

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,950
left and positive frequencies on the

46
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,220
right for images shifting the

47
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,410
coefficients so that the Nyquist

48
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,700
frequency is at the edge

49
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,670
and the low frequencies are in the

50
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,060
middle is almost always done so

51
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,310
typically the image power spectra are

52
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,069
shown with low frequencies in the center

53
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,500
moving out towards higher frequencies

54
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,890
and Nyquist in the corner

55
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,150
computationally that's really all there

56
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,940
is to the 2d Fourier transform what's

57
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,250
tricky is figuring out how to map the

58
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,370
features of an image onto locations in

59
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,849
the 2d Fourier plane and you know when

60
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:45,280
people teach the 2d Fourier transform

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,290
they typically jump immediately straight

62
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,989
into showing power spectra of natural

63
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,540
images but I think it's better to start

64
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,420
with really simple images and first to

65
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,400
try to build a bit of intuition about

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,360
how to interpret the 2d Fourier plane

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,739
therefore what I'm going to do in the

68
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,840
rest of this video is show examples of

69
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,319
how spatial frequency phase and location

70
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,390
affect the 2d Fourier transform in

71
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,549
MATLAB I've set up a movie to illustrate

72
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,070
the relationship between frequency of a

73
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,980
2d sine wave and its representation in

74
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,130
the 2d Fourier plane before running this

75
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,049
simulation I'll show you the layout of

76
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:28,420
the main figure so this is the image

77
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,480
it's a 2d sine wave which is sometimes

78
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,350
also called a sine plane or a gradient

79
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,060
you can see that along this dimension

80
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,209
it's a sine wave and along this

81
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:43,720
dimension it's just straight lines this

82
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,420
is the 2d amplitude spectrum of this

83
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,410
image and this is the phase spectrum and

84
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,049
when I run this code you'll see that the

85
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,579
sine wave is going to change in

86
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,799
frequency over time as will the

87
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,950
amplitude and phase spectra and here

88
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,959
what I'm going to do is hold the phase

89
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,269
which is the orientation of this

90
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,880
gradient constant and change only the

91
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,180
spatial frequency this is like a real

92
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,760
scientific experiment where you hold as

93
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,069
many variables constant as possible and

94
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,260
you change only one variable at a time

95
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,720
in order to understand the effects of

96
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,360
that variable independent of all the

97
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,880
other variables

98
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,160
now you can watch this video and you can

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,650
see that as the spatial frequency of the

100
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,100
sine waves increases the peaks in the

101
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,860
amplitude spectrum move further away

102
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:43,110
from the origin I'll run it again

103
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,970
you can also see some changes in the

104
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,520
width of this peak but this is actually

105
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,560
not a really interesting feature it's

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,750
just due to the non-stationarity x'

107
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,240
related to the spatial frequencies

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,750
relative to the size of this image you

109
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,100
would see the same thing in the time

110
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,230
domain in the amplitude spectrum of a

111
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,750
sine wave that has non integer number of

112
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,680
cycles in the time window the phase

113
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,660
spectrum initially looks like it's

114
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,520
changing a lot and like it's really

115
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,560
granular and there's a lot of noise in

116
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,810
it but these are mostly just rounding

117
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,520
errors and you shouldn't pay too much

118
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,160
attention to them to understand where

119
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,260
these come from you can refer back to

120
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,480
the video about interpreting phase

121
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,030
values and the effects of uncertainty

122
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,670
and noise when the amplitude is close to

123
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,980
zero and you see from the amplitude

124
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,740
spectrum that the amplitude is basically

125
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,790
zero almost everywhere on this plane one

126
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,220
thing I'd like to mention about the

127
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,680
units of the spatial frequency that I

128
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,440
have here these are arbitrary numbers

129
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,060
that I picked because they happen to

130
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,550
look good on my computer screen

131
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,560
depending on your screen resolution

132
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
these values may or may not look good

133
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,640
so I encourage you to play around with

134
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,000
the lower and upper limits until you

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,040
find something that looks good on your

136
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,490
screen this was for sine waves with one

137
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,730
specific phase and it's interesting to

138
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,530
watch what happens when we change the

139
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,650
phase of this 2d sine patch now I'll

140
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,639
change the phase to be PI over four

141
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,889
you can see that the orientation has

142
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,259
changed and importantly the points on

143
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,169
the amplitude spectrum are moving on the

144
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,449
diagonal now instead of moving on this

145
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,599
line here but the behavior is exactly

146
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,259
the same they start close to the center

147
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,580
corresponding to low frequency sine

148
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,650
waves and then they move out towards the

149
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,990
edges in this case the corners as the

150
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,930
sine wave frequency increases I

151
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,699
encourage you to pause the video and

152
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,979
experiment with other phase values and

153
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,460
other spatial frequency ranges now for

154
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,990
the next experiment here I'm going to

155
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,659
hold the spatial frequency constant and

156
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:01,990
change the phase values over time so now

157
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,300
the sine patch will be just rotating

158
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,169
around as if it were the face of a clock

159
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,490
actually this would look pretty neat if

160
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,330
this were at the face of the clock now

161
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,099
notice what's happening in amplitude

162
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:18,400
spectrum the distance from the origin to

163
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,159
the peaks is staying the same but the

164
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:24,759
angle relative to the origin is changing

165
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,560
over time so this experiment is

166
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,430
complementary to the previous experiment

167
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,199
again I encourage you to pause the video

168
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,080
and rerun the code with different values

169
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,240
of spatial frequency and different sine

170
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,729
phases the third experiment is all about

171
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:49,629
spatial location here I'm using a

172
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,509
thresholded 2d gaussian to create a ball

173
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,139
that moves around on the plane the size

174
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,449
of the ball is constant and therefore

175
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,490
the spatial frequency of the ball is

176
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,399
constant only the spatial location of

177
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,689
the ball will change and now running

178
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,279
this code will show that the amplitude

179
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,089
spectrum isn't really changing but the

180
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:15,879
phase spectrum is changing in a way that

181
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,610
is well beautiful to look at but pretty

182
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,060
much impossible to interpret what I mean

183
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,639
by that is if I just showed you this

184
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,759
phase spectrum you might be able to

185
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,529
guess that the stimulus is a circle

186
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,300
based on the spatial pattern

187
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,669
of the phases but you wouldn't be able

188
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:43,959
to guess where in space the ball is I'll

189
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,399
tell you a little bit more about this

190
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,529
code just so you know enough to be able

191
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,350
to continue exploring it on your own the

192
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,000
circle is defined by this gaussian and

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,640
by this threshold which varies between 0

194
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,480
& 1

195
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,940
this determines the size of the circle

196
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,390
and here whatever values are subtracted

197
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,750
off of the x and y matrices correspond

198
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,560
to the center of the circle so in this

199
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,380
video I introduced you to the 2d Fourier

200
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,110
transform I explained mechanistically

201
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,720
how it works by applying the 1d Fourier

202
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
transform first to the columns of a

203
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,579
matrix and then to the rows of the

204
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,760
resulting fft coefficient matrix I then

205
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,130
showed several movies in MATLAB to help

206
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,070
you understand the relationship between

207
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,709
spatial frequency phase spatial location

208
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,930
and the results of the 2d Fourier

209
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,500
transform
