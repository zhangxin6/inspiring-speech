1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,130
oh yeah

2
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,809
give me six reasons why software bellman

3
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,880
doesn't suck so you can't do it

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,079
everybody agrees it's off and there's a

5
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,850
lot of reasons for this one is like

6
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,980
technical getting computers to do what

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,840
you want them to do can be very

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,649
difficult but mostly it's humans humans

9
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,600
are really strange people you're gonna

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,219
deal with like managers you gotta do

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,260
with meeting scheduling deadlines all

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,030
this stuff and that's really what makes

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,570
software development tricky it becomes

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,280
sort of a problem to have to deal with

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,660
all this sort of stuff and people have

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,640
come up with ways to deal with this as

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,360
best as they can

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,610
these are things with you know agile

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,270
waterfall pair programming BDD TDD all

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,799
that stuff whatever is popular at that

21
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,630
given moment and I've tried all of them

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,729
and if they're work for you that's great

23
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,189
the software development is hard but for

24
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,829
those of us

25
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:28,020
okay for those of us who don't buy into

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,869
the whole agile stuff it sucks because I

27
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,000
want to do that guy who's really into

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,920
their process and into their workflow

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,659
because if you're gonna identify with

30
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,950
something that works really well for you

31
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,369
that's amazing and for the longest time

32
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,439
I thought I was just weird I still do

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,350
and I just you know I wanted something

34
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,810
that really worked well for me and I

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,060
think to the point the last year or two

36
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,509
at github we've sort of come down and

37
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,189
figured our development process that is

38
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,869
really interesting it doesn't feel like

39
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,909
process it's really quick it's really

40
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:00,569
fast

41
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:02,700
it scales really well and that's why I

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,979
want to talk about today so this is not

43
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,349
the Safari all sort of this this is how

44
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,380
again it uses github to build github the

45
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,480
secret here is that this isn't really

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,720
about github online I used to get up

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,069
three times in the title so it's sort of

48
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,319
blog github but what I mean by that is

49
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,380
that this is not about github the tool

50
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,090
you know I'll talk about get up the tool

51
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,549
because it's easy to use it as an

52
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:27,870
example for stuff but I really want to

53
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,549
talk about our workflow our process and

54
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,500
how we use our tools and come and choose

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,569
our schools and why that makes for a

56
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,060
really fun development environment so I

57
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,260
don't think this is really about github

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,760
if I work for Twitter I would give the

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,440
same talk about work for Facebook I want

60
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,870
to get the same talk I want this to be a

61
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,569
talk for making you think about how your

62
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,819
company can use the processes and

63
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,709
workflows that we use to improve your

64
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:50,780
own product

65
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,190
so I'm Zach Coleman a woman on Twitter a

66
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,790
moment I get hub I do work for github

67
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,109
it's a social coding site I'm employee

68
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:02,250
number nine so I've been there for about

69
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,400
a year and a half now and we're now 46

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,220
47 employees so we've grown a lot and

71
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,099
I've been able to be there for a year

72
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,720
and a half and see what hasn't worked

73
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,099
out for us how we've changed our

74
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,200
workflow and more importantly what has

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,430
worked for us what assumptions have

76
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,900
remained in beginning that we've been

77
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,109
able to keep with us the entire time so

78
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,459
first of all I want to talk about a

79
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,500
little bit about how we work otherwise

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,489
this talk will probably sound the same

81
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,900
the big part of what we do is we work

82
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,620
asynchronously

83
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,840
so what does this actually mean I look

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,190
this up in a dictionary

85
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,750
and I said you can do without

86
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,280
needing to pull me out of this element

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,600
I read real edgy dictionaries but it's

88
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,470
what's so important for us is that

89
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,330
getting people in the zone is really

90
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,130
important this is the difference between

91
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,100
going to work and you're not in the zone

92
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,390
and you're trying to constantly battle

93
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,550
and try to you know force yourself to

94
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,590
write code and it's one of those cases

95
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,380
where you know throwing hours at the

96
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,300
problem doesn't solve things with

97
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,280
software development you want to be in

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,600
the zone because when you're in the zone

99
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,030
you can do as much an hour as you can

100
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,190
you know 20 hours out of the sounds so

101
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,750
we want to get more people in the zone

102
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,390
or our employees as much as possible and

103
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,400
do that we have no meetings no deadlines

104
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,070
no managers which is you know kind of

105
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,870
insane you can do it to fire all the

106
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,290
managers it's it goes back to this

107
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,930
really works for us it's a very fun

108
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,360
place to work because it gives people in

109
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,040
the zone as much as possible so what

110
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,690
does that what do I mean by that one

111
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,640
chatrooms we do everything in chat room

112
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,140
this sort of stems from one get up as a

113
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,000
three-person company and did everything

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,410
online we didn't have an office for the

115
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,070
first too much years and this really

116
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,780
bring it's through everything if it's

117
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,310
you and me at the office at 2:00 in the

118
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,020
morning no one else is around we're at

119
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,970
the same table we're still going to talk

120
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,640
in the chat room the reason for that is

121
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,890
that personally it lets everybody see

122
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,360
what's going on there's a lot more

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,580
visibility in the company I can go out

124
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,060
to lunch

125
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,360
I can go to Kansas City and when I come

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,700
back whenever I got internet I can see

127
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,050
exactly what happened the company in the

128
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,460
specific areas and it's a much easier

129
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,860
way of like letting everybody get

130
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,510
involved and there's no more secret

131
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,820
projects where only oh that guy knows

132
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,410
that project you'll have to talk to him

133
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:31,870
and arrange a time because that sucks

134
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,570
yes it depends so as an aside we have a

135
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,800
bunch of campfire rooms we have like

136
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,080
twenty or thirty now I don't read the

137
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,610
danger room because that's all the enemy

138
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,710
to gist and cubot reign supreme

139
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,080
that's insane but specific ones where

140
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,190
I'm really involved with like you don't

141
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,690
have enterprise I'll go back and read

142
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,400
the transcript from the last few days

143
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,350
and stuff like that we want to break out

144
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,789
as much as possible in separate groups

145
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:56,500
and then it becomes much more manageable

146
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,039
to see what's going on and your domain

147
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:03,699
of responsibilities and then lastly time

148
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,080
flexibility work when you want to work

149
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,880
this is really important we have a lot

150
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,680
of people coming in the office at like

151
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,210
6:00 in the morning that's definitely

152
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,550
not me because I'm not productive at

153
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,370
that point like we want people to be

154
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,770
productive as much as they can and some

155
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,000
people are super productive in the

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,229
morning and they cannot assume work at

157
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,340
night and that's cool

158
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,270
I'm totally the opposite and mandating

159
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,470
that you have to come in a certain time

160
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,000
and leave those a certain time just

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,490
damages that this brings people out of

162
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,880
the zone so I wrote about this three

163
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,990
parts and stuff you want to check that

164
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,419
out you can but I want to get on to

165
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,760
actual other stuff let's talk about flow

166
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,560
requested branching I think this is a

167
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,150
huge part of what github of course as

168
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,979
well as we do I'll talk about issues I

169
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,419
want to talk about OAuth is identity

170
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,789
hooks and hewlet and secrets so first we

171
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:54,729
request some branching this is sort of

172
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:57,010
the most interesting part of github I

173
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,889
think you guys have really weird

174
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,229
branches and I see the support requests

175
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,090
come in and someone has detailed their

176
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,340
process and like your job just kind of

177
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,050
troughs each paragraph like how do you

178
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,570
work in this fashion and like about this

179
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,849
I mean like there's one company I saw

180
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,070
was a master branch makes sense then

181
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,570
they cut a deploy branch every time they

182
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,580
wanted to deploy makes sense but then

183
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,990
they just cut a deployed branch off of

184
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,330
each individual deploy branch so by the

185
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,949
end of this you have no idea where the

186
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:24,490
hell you are

187
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,860
this is just insane it's overly

188
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,180
complicated you don't need to do this

189
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,080
stuff more likely I see this a lot in

190
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,210
large enterprise companies you have a

191
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,400
repository that you work on then you

192
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,800
have a group

193
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,180
trusted developers these are the guys

194
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,190
with full rewrite access to the repo and

195
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,039
they can do whatever they want and then

196
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:50,569
you have a group this I thought we

197
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:51,979
should be developers because there

198
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,539
obviously must be shitty if they put

199
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,069
them in this separate side and they only

200
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:56,960
give them read access and they're trying

201
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,550
to sell all these arbitrary guidelines

202
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,490
it just seems really insane to me so

203
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,780
what you have is like they all have to

204
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,340
port their own projects from the main

205
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,050
repository all those Forks that have to

206
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,120
go back to the trust developers for them

207
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,530
to figure out okay is this good to go

208
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,240
back in the real repository it's not

209
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,009
making us image the Shiva lovers and

210
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,210
then they pulled on new changes to the

211
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,969
repository if you see a chart like this

212
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:18,349
in your organisation's something is

213
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:22,659
 up keep your branches simple I

214
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,680
think this is really important this is

215
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,379
fundamentally important this is sort of

216
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,669
the foundation where you build your

217
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:41,180
product all right no controlling you

218
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:53,360
know you mean the stuff I was going to

219
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:08,740
cover in the next minute

220
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:17,120
you know so keep your branches simple

221
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,850
branches should be simple let's talk

222
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,990
about how we do branching because I

223
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,910
think obviously we have a perfect

224
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,569
branching situation here document what

225
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,639
we have is a master branch and then we

226
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,959
have a branch where you work on a bug

227
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,689
fix or a feature or anything like that

228
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:34,250
when you're done with that that goes a

229
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,069
master this is it that's the entire

230
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:39,230
branching strategy we don't really

231
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,970
branch off with separate branches or do

232
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,949
anything more complex than this and it

233
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,689
becomes a lot easier to bring out

234
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:46,220
somebody new and just sail where you cut

235
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,139
a branch when that's ready to go in push

236
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,560
the master along with that every push

237
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,779
everyone deploy our designer on their

238
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:57,199
first day can deploy to github we have a

239
00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:00,019
lot of automation surrounding 2.2 the

240
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,839
50-plus servers we have now and that's

241
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,600
good we want people to have

242
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,800
responsibility over the code that they

243
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,139
actually write too many times you have

244
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,490
something more like a release manager

245
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,779
where you push it with a really release

246
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,180
manager and then that becomes their

247
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,980
responsibility for the stuff we want

248
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,269
people who write the stuff to be

249
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:19,730
responsible this also frees yourself up

250
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,019
from micromanaging other people's code

251
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,639
the trust developers in the shade

252
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,920
developers part you want people to be

253
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,500
responsible for their own code for us

254
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,269
master is always employable this is like

255
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,519
the one part of rule that is constant at

256
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,769
github if you push the master a sua can

257
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:37,160
be deployed as soon as it passes CI the

258
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
reason we do this is because we deploy

259
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,089
10 to 40 times a day we like very short

260
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,519
changes and it's something breaks you

261
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,019
know exactly what breaks really quickly

262
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,089
if you're nervous you employed a staging

263
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:48,559
we have separate staging environment we

264
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,660
can also deploy separate branches and

265
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,430
test that out and deploy the master

266
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,149
afterwards

267
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:54,829
you know so the point of stuff set so if

268
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:56,569
you could say like let me just deploy

269
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,819
two boxes right away and see if anything

270
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:00,529
blows up if it doesn't inversion in the

271
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,089
master

272
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:03,550
from there this is also sort of Twitter

273
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,470
driven development because you guys are

274
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,959
way more on top of things than we are

275
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,240
sometimes and like people will tweet

276
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,670
constantly if something breaks now we

277
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,470
have like graphs and stuff we're like

278
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,600
you know number of exceptions and then

279
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,999
deploy is really marked on the graph and

280
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:21,100
then we mark that against every flies to

281
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,749
get love on Twitter and it's actually

282
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,209
very proportional to you know you break

283
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,970
something people will talk about it so

284
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,759
keep your branches simple that's really

285
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,800
important I know what you guys are

286
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,720
thinking you know what about code

287
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,269
equality the other designer in

288
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,740
there messing with your code

289
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,209
no one likes designers they do weird

290
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:42,699
stuff so we'll how do you keep up code

291
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,829
quality and our response to that is pull

292
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,110
requests this is central to everything

293
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,120
we do pull requests our code review what

294
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,029
are Laurie bus tour bus our discussion

295
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,519
it's a simple discussion about a piece

296
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,899
of code indistinct piece of code it's a

297
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,370
discussion about codes just mention

298
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,170
about that particular feature discussion

299
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,389
about that particular strategy all this

300
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:09,009
stuff comes together you can do a bunch

301
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,079
of different stuff to it you can

302
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:12,699
reference issues in it you can reference

303
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,589
other bits of code disks in it you can

304
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:16,660
write code comments it's all about

305
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,370
figuring out how you make a discussion

306
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,660
on piece of code and then from that

307
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,069
point you can figure out do you want

308
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,990
this in the actual code base all this

309
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,879
stuff happens on a separate branch so

310
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,139
none of the stuff ends up being

311
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,209
dangerous because it's separate from

312
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,420
your production code until it's ready

313
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,160
this is what it looks like I'm sure most

314
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,389
of you guys actually know what Laurie

315
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,730
quests are but you know it's title

316
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,980
description and bunch of commits once

317
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,120
those commits are done that you can

318
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,639
discuss on those commits and discuss

319
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,050
them more than you commit and then you

320
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,920
get merged back into the master

321
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,910
whatever branch that you're trying to

322
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,570
version into the poultry bus itself is

323
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,790
broken out into a discussion where you

324
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,769
can actually talk about the changes the

325
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,450
commits or you show the commits and then

326
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,070
the diff where you can actually see what

327
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,690
has actually changed in the code and

328
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,810
this is really cool because we're really

329
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,420
large to get up at this point and no one

330
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,250
person can really take it to every line

331
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,110
of code that's changed but it's

332
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,699
important that you have a lot of people

333
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:12,620
know what you're doing so for a lot of

334
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,089
claw requests I won't look at the actual

335
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:15,529
code I'll just look at the discussion

336
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,149
and see like the title description and

337
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:18,709
that's a good way it's sort of like an

338
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,750
RSS of what development is happening

339
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,699
without having to sit down and do a

340
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:24,019
stand-up meeting or anything like that I

341
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,360
can just see it in my inbox as it goes

342
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
by and it's very simple

343
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,470
so I lied this isn't actually our

344
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,990
development strategy it's more similar

345
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,810
to this where you branch off send the

346
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,070
port west and then merge it in the

347
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,350
master and that's sort of the guard

348
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,180
against any really shitty code deployed

349
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,380
accidentally so vixa kind of one you

350
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,850
don't need a fork anything this is sort

351
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,519
of our common misconception you can do

352
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,500
poor request between branches on the

353
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,199
same repo and that's what we do

354
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,579
consistently and give up we don't fork

355
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:57,560
the main github repo all the time we're

356
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,329
just do pork was between into more

357
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:01,430
individual branches and then you have to

358
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,380
set up weird permission strategies to

359
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,610
let people under your different force

360
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,440
and stuff it's just a much simpler way

361
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,810
to do things

362
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,430
so why employed was actually rad for

363
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,290
reasons one they're asynchronous no

364
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,260
meetings

365
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,279
everybody's had that time where you're

366
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,500
in a cobra do in person and you're

367
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,149
projecting code on the wall you're

368
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,740
trying to figure out like okay you're

369
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,570
running it through your MRI in your head

370
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,709
you're trying to figure out okay this

371
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:27,199
compiles to this and does this it's a

372
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,480
terrible way of reviewing code with poor

373
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,709
requests you can easily pull down the

374
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,649
diff and run it locally and you can do

375
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:34,790
that whenever you want you don't have to

376
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,050
have a separate meeting on that stuff

377
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,970
it's really helpful to have it broken

378
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,920
away from some sort of synchronous like

379
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,319
this has to get reviewed right now and

380
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:44,350
stuff like that

381
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,940
certainly emails a good interface for

382
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,769
this too when I wake up in the morning I

383
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,920
can see all blow requests of a generator

384
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,930
from Europe for example and so again

385
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,910
this is a quite easy way to figure out

386
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,050
what's going on in the company without

387
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,480
mandating some standup which doesn't

388
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,190
even work when half your team is across

389
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,310
the world they're also really accessible

390
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,450
and we use this a lot

391
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,310
designers evolve entire mock-ups in

392
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,230
imploring words and that's really

393
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,550
powerful too it's like sort of merging

394
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,199
control for a mock-up so you can see as

395
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,290
you go along what what the mock-up has

396
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,940
changed over time to keep discuss on

397
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,920
that - we also have a bunch of

398
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,630
non-technical staff like we have a

399
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,519
shipper who ships out all your beautiful

400
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,550
shop stuff and she can go in and check

401
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,990
out a flurry quest like this is gonna

402
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,389
change the shop get up calm site can you

403
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:30,399
actually say like does this make sense

404
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,050
yeah she doesn't have to go see the code

405
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,850
did but she can see what's actually

406
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,209
happening and check it out they're also

407
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,310
historical making the experiments in

408
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,570
this should be experiments we have a lot

409
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,889
of pull requests that are designed not

410
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,260
to ever get deployed because we want to

411
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,880
see okay what do you guys think about

412
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,320
this interface what do you think about

413
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,810
this API like this does make sense it

414
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,190
does then I can just close the floor

415
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,720
request and then actually build it for

416
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,850
real don't be afraid to try something

417
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,890
out throw it away because it retains the

418
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,010
history and they should be really fun to

419
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,170
make you should not have to fear about

420
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,930
doing some insane experiment when you're

421
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,800
drunk and seeing how it works out so I

422
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,029
want to show you just a couple point

423
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,140
four requests that we do at github it's

424
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,180
a little bit more context static demo

425
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,279
calm there was a problem a while ago

426
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,769
again were you guys caught stuff before

427
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,970
we did or more or correctly we would get

428
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,290
like the notifications that something is

429
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,149
down but it took us another couple

430
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,769
minutes to actually update the status ID

431
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:32,380
so I added something just real time

432
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,910
pulling of different services on

433
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,740
github.com just to see if they're up and

434
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,110
this is a pull request now started out

435
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,810
just with a bare-bones interface and I

436
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,399
just dumped this on a page it would

437
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,870
check this and I didn't have to care

438
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,920
about styling or anything like that

439
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,350
because I knew it once I posted this

440
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,540
summer would come in and be like I want

441
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,910
to design that and that's where we have

442
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,040
a lot where designers

443
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,990
just gonna sort of you know see what's

444
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,610
happening the company and when it's

445
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,170
ready for them to come in they'll do a

446
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,630
design at that point I have a design act

447
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,310
build on that and commit to that design

448
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,660
and then just match it and it's very

449
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,130
easy for me I never have to worry about

450
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,480
that in the slightest and there's no

451
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,220
love front meetings it just all happens

452
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,770
very asynchronously by the end of it we

453
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,569
close it merchant shipping and that's it

454
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,020
it's very simple very easy you should

455
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,669
not be afraid to mix your designers and

456
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,780
developers they should work together

457
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,980
just like or bus are kind of scary from

458
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,510
a designer's point of view but they

459
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,679
don't have to get into the nitty-gritty

460
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,299
if they don't want to it's it's helpful

461
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,950
for them to get into the discussion

462
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,540
section don't be pretty close

463
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,260
screenshots a lot you can use you can

464
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,179
use this in the markdown which I'll show

465
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,510
you in a couple seconds but it's very

466
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,549
good to be very visual even on back-end

467
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:44,280
stuff you can also post gifs because

468
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,240
they're funny we do that a lot we also

469
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,760
have something called code editing or

470
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,140
it's a syntax highlighting in your code

471
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,030
editor and this was like earlier this

472
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,419
year and this entire pull request we did

473
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:58,710
all this stuff did this bunch of

474
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,120
discussion and then we're like

475
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,010
it doesn't work we can't do it close it

476
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,320
and that's it that's important that's

477
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,659
still really good because they're cheap

478
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:07,980
as hell you shouldn't be afraid to

479
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,590
experiment that seemed really kind of a

480
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,000
bummer at first this we really wanted

481
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,340
this to work out but the library we were

482
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,409
using didn't work out don't be afraid to

483
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,960
toss it away this was great because five

484
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,640
or six months later we found a different

485
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,290
library that did a lot better and

486
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,390
integrins and it works how we wanted it

487
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,409
to work and we could go back to the

488
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:27,210
original claw request and say what was

489
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,370
my design decisions here what did I

490
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,140
wanted to hear and then you don't have

491
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,890
to reinvent the wheel every time so

492
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,000
really play around pull request visible

493
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,230
request that started the beginning this

494
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,650
year hasn't shipped yet it's got a bunch

495
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,470
of stuff in it and that's really cool we

496
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,880
can hire somebody tomorrow and if

497
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080
they're asking what they want to work on

498
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,419
we can point them to this there's no you

499
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,850
know back alleyway deals about like you

500
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,280
know communicate between two people then

501
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,049
they need to have to chase down somebody

502
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:56,340
else if you like please tell me what

503
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,390
your thoughts are on this

504
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,980
it's all right here we can go back later

505
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,760
to check it out kitchens done don't

506
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,920
waste your time

507
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,690
just this is something that you have to

508
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,040
constantly worry about like can you

509
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,600
would improve your workflow can you make

510
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,210
it a lot better and it's something that

511
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,470
you have to do constantly because

512
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,760
otherwise will sneak up on you and

513
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,630
really you down the road so recap

514
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,860
news pull request more they're awesome

515
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,040
ship a lot more I think they're really

516
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,120
great I think they're really important

517
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,040
and if you are able to do them in your

518
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,610
company

519
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,940
I should investigate almost I go to

520
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,950
choose everybody has issues of different

521
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,390
companies I'm talking about like tickets

522
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,280
stuff like that

523
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,410
so everybody see the screen like this

524
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,290
like a new issue create screen the

525
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,690
problem of this is there's a lot of

526
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,540
stuff going on here and some of the

527
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,950
makes sense and you're like okay yeah

528
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,140
that's cool and then they just layer

529
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,030
more and more stuff on there before you

530
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,200
know what there's some up

531
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,770
going on there turn figure out what is

532
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,600
what is the point of all this stuff like

533
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,920
duplicating priorities and stuff like

534
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,460
that this is the one and you know calm

535
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,620
and this is not again about get up this

536
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,080
is the tool we choose internally all it

537
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,630
is is title description and we do away

538
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,760
with a whole bunch of priorities and

539
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,280
craziness because for the most part you

540
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,710
don't need to ask you something about

541
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,500
survival simpler tools can work better

542
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,900
and faster on simpler tools I think you

543
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,370
can brother man I sort of have a man

544
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,590
crush on him Twitter crush these amazing

545
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,050
hero this awesome post on email

546
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,210
priorities they said the priorities was

547
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,440
they're not manufacturer signing

548
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,880
otherwise necessarily not a priority

549
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,040
making something a big red top topic

550
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,120
highest number one priority changes

551
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,500
nothing but textile we're really

552
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,360
important there would be done period I

553
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,010
think that's really important he's

554
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,750
talked about email but the same is true

555
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,880
for stuff across the board issues

556
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,100
prioritization dragging dropping like

557
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,990
all these issues to prioritize and stuff

558
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,060
think about if you actually need that if

559
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,680
you do that's cool then use it but if

560
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,300
you don't need that you're wasting a lot

561
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,120
of time there's all this stuff that we

562
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,910
have as developers asking to get rid of

563
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,670
all of it resist any metal work it gets

564
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,770
in the way of real work the real work

565
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,980
will get done quickly your we use issues

566
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,700
for three things should something broken

567
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,840
something is broken that gets fixed in

568
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,210
few hours that's it we also use issues

569
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,640
or wouldn't it be cool if and then you

570
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
it's nice to have a discussion this is

571
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,610
prior to the flooring quest because you

572
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,260
don't want to throw it on code yet but

573
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,600
it's fun to talk about we also use as

574
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,330
to-do lists sometimes that's just kind

575
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,680
of an easy way you don't have to set up

576
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,770
a weird you know issue tracking you know

577
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,450
to do report or something like that it's

578
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,880
all just one in one issue do you need

579
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,160
more than that really think about that

580
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,100
the most time you don't sometimes you do

581
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,960
which is fine almost of time you don't

582
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,970
simple tools means a better product

583
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,110
because you can build it simpler okay oh

584
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,900
office identity this is fun

585
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,710
I love Ruby I really love Ruby I'm not

586
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,090
talking about like the speed of Ruby

587
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,440
because it is slow sticks I'm talking

588
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,000
about like how fast is to build

589
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,980
something like it is really fast and

590
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,510
build something so I looked through my

591
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,940
development folder about what projects I

592
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,840
have in there and I have one called

593
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,750
Secretary of Labor all caps I was really

594
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,150
drunk when I wrote this and I saw in the

595
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,190
next morning it's just a signal Sinatra

596
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,290
app and it's got a stuff referential

597
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,760
symlink called what that points to

598
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,370
itself I have no idea what it does I

599
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,440
have one called unmarked van which

600
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,680
attracts people's physical locations a

601
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,240
one called trace is a real-time stats

602
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,340
graphing in Redis the point is all this

603
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,870
stuff is really fun to make it was fun

604
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,850
experiment none of this stuff is ever

605
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,610
shipping especially not that first one

606
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,300
but it's fun to try stuff out and we do

607
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,560
this stuff and give up too we have a

608
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,140
bunch of internal apps we have you know

609
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,610
probably have more than this at this

610
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,740
point but some of them are more fun some

611
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,510
of them are very serious ci stuff like

612
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,160
that we have an internal Twitter which

613
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,750
is more fun status updates and stuff

614
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,640
like that the point is that we want

615
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,020
people experimenting keeps things really

616
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,110
funny keeps things interesting the

617
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,430
problem with all this is that Outsiders

618
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,990
aren't welcome like we're really open

619
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,430
company but you don't wants people just

620
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,780
trudging through all your stuff so yeah

621
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,850
that's an authentication layer for us we

622
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,410
use github for that medication layer we

623
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,930
have all of our team's our orgs in give

624
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,900
up so we just use a lot to attempt that

625
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,670
and use that as sort of medication and

626
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,010
all of these separate mini apps you guys

627
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,050
what we all see in the screen the you

628
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,040
know a lot of them to check out your

629
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,650
profile

630
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,020
yes no you can use this in a bunch of

631
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,610
different ways there's a whole bunch of

632
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,240
different Ruby libraries this is one

633
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,950
done by Atmos all we have to do is just

634
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,180
check whether or not they're a member of

635
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,830
the github or if they are lemon in the

636
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,470
app it's very easy if we you know hire

637
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,710
somebody we don't have to update 30 40

638
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,240
different apps we have it's all in one

639
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,850
place it's just a nice consistent way of

640
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,550
doing things think about like if you

641
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,530
have this problem can you pawn it off on

642
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,140
somebody else and that means github a

643
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,580
lot of people on Twitter now you can use

644
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,790
Twitter's authentication for that or you

645
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,200
know if you're big enough to have your

646
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,790
own it internally that server or

647
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,950
whatever you got just don't reinvent the

648
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,980
wheel it's good to use a consolidated

649
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,670
feature for all this stuff okay let's

650
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,470
talk about cubot everybody what you

651
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,960
bought so free so you bots are friendly

652
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,510
campfire bots he's cool even do some

653
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,290
stuff the other trainer commands for us

654
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,630
employer github app this is important

655
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,850
when you have 50 some servers because

656
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,250
you have no idea how to employ all that

657
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,660
stuff so we just say you might deploy

658
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,970
exit to production and he doesn't that's

659
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,540
great

660
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,160
I mean you're on branch level tests so

661
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,080
if you push the branch up that will just

662
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,090
run automatically if like using in the

663
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,950
office and you tell us who is in the

664
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,480
office based on a white/black presence

665
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,830
on their MAC address on their phone or

666
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,160
their laptop bill abusive drastic in

667
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,450
charge all those exceptions for such

668
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,340
deploys versus Twitter mentions send

669
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,929
receive text messages your mustache

670
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,620
every image posted chat like that

671
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,000
attract who swears the most every day

672
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,309
you know we can do all this stuff and

673
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,170
it's more fun because it's a shared side

674
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,460
project again and it's fun to have

675
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,980
experimentation use cool technologies

676
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,470
it's too bad he's not open source I'm

677
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,110
sorry is that open source that's look

678
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,730
like last week it's awesome we have like

679
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,440
tons of adapters now using IRC campfire

680
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,720
XMPP and tons of stuff so check them out

681
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,730
if you haven't already this is a really

682
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,930
fun project you have it

683
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,630
your company in terms of how we use them

684
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,090
for github we use them a bunch of

685
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,980
different ways specifically we use them

686
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,900
for branch status a lot you're gonna ask

687
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,610
you about what hasn't been deployed and

688
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,860
he'll return it and compare view of what

689
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,210
has been deployed yet so you know if

690
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,860
you're gonna deploy this these are the

691
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,600
concrete disks that have been deployed

692
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,370
yet and be worried about these if you

693
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,680
deploy we can do this on a different

694
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,270
branch to surgery and deploy a separate

695
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,860
branch to production or you know you

696
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,870
want to know what on that branch has

697
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,970
been version master yet you can do all

698
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,970
this it all stems from this shop which

699
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,710
we know what does the currently deployed

700
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,490
code on github because it's all in this

701
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,980
one site it's just an endpoint and use

702
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,570
this all over the place like CI stuff

703
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,650
like that

704
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,870
it's just a nice helpful way of doing

705
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,160
that and you can build it with your pair

706
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,010
of use and it's fun because he was long

707
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,920
the API and get up to I can ask it one

708
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,090
of the Pollard bus on my particular

709
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,980
repository and I'll sit back all the

710
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,680
quarry quests very simple very easy it

711
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,070
becomes a nice way of setting the to-do

712
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,440
list if you're ever like what should I

713
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,650
work on today this is nice way to start

714
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,300
we also have the same thing for issues

715
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,980
we have bug days every like second

716
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,780
Thursday or so just as a way to clear

717
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,520
out little issues and this is kind of

718
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,930
fun you can ask it humming it's doing

719
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,450
close to it and you know I'm back how

720
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,740
many issues you close today it's another

721
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,600
way it's sort of you know I hate the

722
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,850
word but like gamification of like your

723
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,770
work it's fun to be like how can we do

724
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,420
more issues knocked out this week than

725
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,690
we did the last time it's fun

726
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,830
think about what you can automate at

727
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,240
your company because the stuff that

728
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,950
really sucks are the things that you

729
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,420
have to repeatedly do over and over

730
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,490
again and we're developers it's it's fun

731
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,980
to of over-engineer stuff sometimes and

732
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,570
like you'll spend way more time

733
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,730
automating something then you think

734
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,750
you'll get out of it but you'll actually

735
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,190
get a lot more out of it than you

736
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,790
probably think

737
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,820
plus it's really fun to do so the moral

738
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,920
of story about knows we live I don't

739
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,310
know he's freaking finally I just want

740
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,420
to talk about some cigarettes I don't

741
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,280
blow through these because github got

742
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,380
some funny secrets we talk stuff away

743
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,730
sometimes our bad here's the fun stuff

744
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,810
you can have emoji all those fun things

745
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,070
we do these I'm flow requests all the

746
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,880
time we just

747
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,150
one stuff we say art I don't know it's

748
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,380
fun it's a fun way of getting people

749
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,570
involved on stuff really cool go to that

750
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,039
link to see a whole list of emoji and

751
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,809
stuff like that all my slides are up on

752
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:51,820
my site later you can check out these

753
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,240
links and stuff later shortcuts if you

754
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,679
guys don't know all this stuff W will

755
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,179
bring up the branch selector on a repo

756
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,820
page he will do the finding project sort

757
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,470
of like the text mining project really

758
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,510
quick I mean you can press a question

759
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,710
mark on any page you'll bring up the

760
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,080
help dialog and those like crap-ton of

761
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,150
the shortcuts you can do to do a bunch

762
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,039
of different stuff issues for example

763
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,840
has a whole bunch of quick access to

764
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,450
issues images images are awesome

765
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,130
especially when they're animated this is

766
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,409
the markdown format for posting an image

767
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:23,320
into issues this will post the image on

768
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,419
force this only works if you dorky

769
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:27,580
dodgeball team is the image I'm just

770
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:41,409
kidding that's our basketball team dodge

771
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:43,360
well we waited 50 grand it was great for

772
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,760
charity not broken also different patch

773
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,440
I mean it was based on a mailing list

774
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,659
point of view so all of this stuff that

775
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:54,760
we expose on github is also available in

776
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,520
text basically to just add get the duck

777
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,740
tip or dot patch after most URLs and

778
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,940
will spit out a nice thing that you can

779
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,520
put directly to get later the other

780
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,980
thing we have is Sprint's code this is

781
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,960
sort of a you did the formatting of any

782
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,640
code that you can taste into issues or

783
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,320
requests stuff like that all you have to

784
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,240
do is triple tick and then say what

785
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,679
language you want and it will syntax

786
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:16,750
highlight for that language a nice quick

787
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,190
thing to do especially doing in read

788
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,990
these because read knees would just

789
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,940
blocks of code in them kind of sucks

790
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,320
it's nice to have that syntactically

791
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,750
highlighted mentions we use this a lot

792
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,390
they're gonna open a issue we usually

793
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,820
add like CC you know at TechnoMarine e

794
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,500
or at defunct and then that will notify

795
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,659
them and get them to put their eyes on

796
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:36,280
your floor request it's a nice way of

797
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,679
just having communication amongst your

798
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,289
requests issues stuff like that whites

799
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:43,630
facing that question mark w equals one

800
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,880
to reduce whitespace and disks

801
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,080
sometimes that's really help

802
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,330
of some dice an employer requests with a

803
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,620
whole bunch of whitespace changes and

804
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,279
you're like I don't even know like

805
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,679
changing what needs a way to do that

806
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,340
repo references you can cross you can

807
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,559
reference issues and pull requests

808
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:02,080
across different repositories so you

809
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,480
just in your issue body just say like

810
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,429
user sorry mode and number of signed

811
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,100
issues and that will bring in the link

812
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,820
on the referenced issue and it'll just

813
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,730
connect the two visually in the webpage

814
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,159
it's kind of nice I have a sumo

815
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,289
announcement right now we have a URL

816
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:22,149
shortener we've been using for a while

817
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:25,149
now I'm announcing this here because I

818
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:27,730
can so if you have a really long URL you

819
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,000
can shorten it to get that IOU RL you do

820
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,750
that via this is a very simple service

821
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,519
the the Ren URL down there is actually a

822
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,529
gist that actually shows you how to set

823
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:39,970
up a shell script to do all this for you

824
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,260
so if you ever want to tweet something

825
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,539
or have some shortened URL or if you

826
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:45,279
want to snag one for your vanity URL

827
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,110
comm slash hold and stuff like that

828
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,510
that's nice way to do it check out all

829
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:54,549
these links in my talk later slides so

830
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:57,039
that's the recap really think through

831
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,980
this stuff this is the stuff that will

832
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,750
bite you further down the line unless

833
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,880
you really think it to reach time and

834
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,200
the problem is that you don't notice it

835
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,210
being a problem until it's too late and

836
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,679
then when you can't go back and fix it

837
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:10,149
so it's got to be a constant battle of

838
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:11,830
like what kind of group how can I make

839
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,779
my developers happier do I really need

840
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,970
all this extra stuff and then I think

841
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,950
you can make cool products so thanks
